# batch_emails_from_google_sheet (Google Apps Script)

This script is written for Google Apps Script and it lets you take a long list of email addresses in a Google Sheet, and send a message to them in batches (of 25, or 50). It sends through the email used to create the Google Sheet, thus if you are using a free GMail account you will want to check the current limits on batches and total per day.
